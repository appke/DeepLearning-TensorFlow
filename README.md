this is the homework according to YouTube online courses of Prof. Lee from National Taiwan University

veeeery understandable and clear <https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLJV_el3uVTsPy9oCRY30oBPNLCo89yu49>

i took some notes which i think it's interesting and new for me, and it's in English, not very detailed, but include important conclusions i got from the course, hope you could find something useful.

HW2 is about using education, nationality and other features to predict the incomes. I both tensorflow, and keras... the accuracy on validation data is about ~86% Cheers!

HW3 is doing the sentiment classification, the descripiton of HW, and data link can be found from<https://ntumlta.github.io/ML-Assignment3/index.html> I also upload the notes i took in lectures :

1. why we using CNN for image processing?
2. tips for DNN (how to improve the model by analysis the performance on training and validation data)
3. Why Deep? (why not wide) (because of memrory problem, the result is not good [bad, i would say (o(╥﹏╥)o)]), if you have bigger memory, you could deeper the network, which I think is quite simple using keras.

If you have the same problem like me, you could utilize the tips in "Tipps for DNN" to improve the result in HW2.

Cheers!
